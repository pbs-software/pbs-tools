      - Include stype=17 (UNKNOWN SAMPLE TYPE FOR NMFS TRIENNIAL SURVEY) to function argument default.
      - Add switch for NMFS Triennial survey ages (where ameth=0)
      - Sometimes catch weight is not reported but the age sample is still OK so set catch weight to 1.

  * M07_CatchRecon.r
    + Modified function `buildCatch':
      - Changed argument `refyrs' from vector to list of vectors so that each fishery can have its own set. (RH 190917)
      - Changed name of collection object from `PBStool' to `CR'.
      - Code creates file `run.details.txt' to contain the argument values and is written to the base of `run.name'. (RH 190924)
      - Added SBF and LIN trawl catch for years 1950-75 from Ketchen (1976) to be used as TAR for FIDs 3 and 4, respectively. (RH 190917)
      - Sabotaged `ph3cat' object to remove all trawl records & non-trawl records from 2006 on (RH 190926)
      - PH3 ORF landings appear to be additive for FIDs 2,3,4 and  redundant for FID 5 wrt to GFM landings. (RH 190926)
      - Changed name of collection object `GRATES' to `RATES', which now collects all the converion rates like alpha, beta, gamma, delta, etc.
      - Stopped overwriting DB TAR with supplemental TAR if DB TAR already exists (e.g., PAH) when calculating discards.
    + Modified function `buildCatch' to components of the depth-stratified gamma and delta ratios. (RH 190605)
      - Prompted by reconciling the 2015 YYR catch reconstruction with a current build for Dana Haggarty.
    + Fixed a small bug in function `surveyCatch' -- added `tabDir' argument. (RH 190605)
  * SQL code
    + Added new query `fos_mcatSPP.sql' to summarise catch fro the `weightBio' function. (RH 190807)
      - Code based on `fos_mcatORF.sql' and modified to yield similar output to `fos_catch_records.sql'.
      - Function `getCatch' still uses four separate functions but this new function should supercede three of the queries for commercial catch.
    + Updated `meanSppWt.sql' to contain defaults for all species in GFBioSQL. (RH 190807)
      - Default values taken from GFBioSQL view `GFB_SPECIES_MEAN_WEIGHT'
      - Bogs down other queries that use mean weights to convert pieces for many species but
      - New field in `meanSppWt.sql' called `FISH' can reduce this time if WHERE FW.FISH IN (1)

  * M01_Utility.r
    + Fixed bug in function `crossTab' which occurred when one character summarising field contained empty string. (RH 190128)
      - Added new argument `na.str' to use when empty string occurs in character fields that summarise data.
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Modified function `histTail' slightly to put function objects into `obj.histTail'. (RH 190131)
  * M03_Fishery.r
    + Updated function `getCatch' to reload binary rda files every time if `sql=FALSE'. (RH 181231)
  * M05_Spatial.r

    + Modified function `calcHabitat' to reflect call options to `findHoles'. (RH 190131)
    + Changed the algorithm in function `findHoles' to identify solids with holes. (RH 190131)
      - Started with a bug in calculating Widow Rockfish bathymetry habitat.
      - New logical argument `use.sp.pkg' gives two options for determining if one polygon lies inside another.
      - (i) continue using `sp::point.in.polygon' or (ii) use `PBSmapping::.is.in' (but the latter is 3x slower).
    + Fixed bug in function `.preferDepth.getDepth' where PBSdat was not manipulated correctly, causing PLOT button to re-query depths on SQL Server. (RH 190122)
    + Modified function `plotEO' to use generic `prefix' argument and to call function `zapSeamounts' if new argument `rmSM' is TRUE. (RH 190122)
    + Created new function `findEP' to find events in polygons and add ID from PolySet's PolyData to events. (RH 190121)

      - Added new logistic method `VH' based on Vivian Haist's maturity code in NZ Rock Lobster model.
      - Renamed methods {`empir', `logit', `dblnorm'} to {`EMP', `BL', `DN'}.
      - Added new arguments `year' (numeric vector to qualify data), `mpoints' (logical to add model points), `rlines' (logical to add raw lines).
      - Changed argument `parList' to be a list of lists because methods `DN' and `VH' use different parVecs in `calcMin'.
      - Added new subfunctions `fitVH' and `calcVH' for the Vivian Haist logistic method.
      - Added new subfuntion `amendLeg' to update legend text when called by each method specified for fitting.
      - Internal object `CALCS' now collects parameter estimates, age-at-50% maturity (p50), and age-at-full maturity (mu) for each method.
      - Parameter estimates, etc. now spat out into par file.
    + Revised function `calcSG' to mirror function `calcVB'. (RH 181129)
    + Revised function `weightBio'. (RH 181128)
      - Added new logical argument `accum' to accumulate ages above `plus', or not.
      - Replaced age qualification base on `ameth' with a call to function `extractAges'.
    + Modified function `calcVB' to not plot figures if new argument `figures=FALSE'. (RH 181126)
      - Primarily used when fitting numerous VBs to various PMFC areas for tables in App D Biology.
      - Modified function `calcLW' to subtitle middle plot only (needs some work disabling plots when user only wants tables).

  * M07_CatchRecon.r
    + Modified function `buildCatch' to use/discard foreign catch reported by GFBioSQL in GF_MERGED_CATCH table. (RH 181127)
      - Actions depend on whether argument `useFF' is TRUE or FALSE.
      - Allocation to FIDs 1-5 based on gear type reported by FID 9 (foreign catch) records.
      - Usually fid 9 catch is negligible (and ignored) but WWR had substantial amounts reported from midwater trawl in 1982, 1987-1991, 2000.
  * R code
    + Changed method of constructing language output file name using the switch function. (RH 181210)
      - Previously, if l=="f" preceded l=="e" in `lang' loop, the english directory was not reset properly.
      - Affected modules: M02_Biology.r, M04_Survey.r, M05_Spatial.r, M06_Assessment.r, M07_CatchRecon.r
  * SQL code
    + Modified `gfb_bio.sql' again to deal with rogue trip-survey combinations. (RH 181219)
      - Basically undid the previous change of 181212.
      - Identified original-index surveys differently than before and removed the SVID 79 for the 2006 WCHG.
      - Introduced super SSID values to deal with H&L trips that execute multiple SSIDs.
      - Ideally, this should be resolved at the fishing event level but have yet to do so.
    + Modified `gfb_bio.sql' to deal somewhat with trips that execute multiple surveys like than for Sablefish (RH 181212)
      - Update SURVEY_SERIES_ID from GROUPING table:
      -  sablefish/shrimp SSIDs not always identified correctly to this point in the query.
      - Note: If SSID has been automatically selected to be the first ORIGINAL_INDEX of multiple original indices
      -  and GROUPING_CODE in GROUPING is NULL, e.g., because REASON_CODE=21 (exploratory FEID),
      -  then misidentified SSID (e.g., 41) will not be updated to actual SSID (e.g., 43).
      - There is no easy work around at this point, short of a specific SQL patch for odd cases (not implemented).
    + Added new pivot query to find the maximum age of rockfish species by all ageing methods. (RH 181107)
      - Stemmed from a review of SME (subject matter expert) reports on Offshore Rockfish for Spatial Analysis group.
  * Documentation
    + Added new sqript `md2pdf.bat' to convert markdown files to pdf via html. (RH 181217)
      - Third party executables `pandoc.exe' (https://pandoc.org) and `wkhtmltopdf.exe' (https://wkhtmltopdf.org/) need to be installed and put on Path.
    + Added README.pdf, based on Markdown page on GitHub, to Vignettes directory. (RH 181121)

      - Based on code at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33483286/r-look-for-abbreviation-in-full-string
    + Added new function `findPV' to find nearest position in vector choice using a target point. (RH 181109)
      - Based on code snippet at https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2008-July/167216.html
    + Added new function `findRC' to find number of rows and columns for plotting multi-panel figures (RH 181108)
      - Similar to function PBSmodelling::.findSquare
      - Uses given number of figures (nf) to fit on one page.
    + Changed GF server IP address (2018-10-22)
      - Notification from Norm Olsen: On 2018-10-23, the SSC Networks team is working to change the network subnet for Nanaimo PBS site.
      - Current GF server assigned a new IP address (10.114.52.8) on the network to move it to a new subnet.

1.38.3 (2018-10-12) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Added new function `extractAges' to subset a biological data object for records with positive ages. (RH 181012)
    + Modified function `plotProp' to use function `extractAges'. (RH 181012)
      - Other functions subsetting by ageing method will eventually use `extractAges'.
    + Further modified function `mapMaturity' to deal with collections of regions (RH 180907)
      - Vector argument `major' changed to list argument `areas'.
    + Modified function `mapMaturity' to plot proportions by sex in areas. (RH 180830)
      - Idea suggested by PJS for ARF (Arrowtooth Flounder) in PMFCs 5E, 5CD, 5AB, and 3CD.
      - Code recognises this shift in functionality when is.null(mats) && is.list(major).
  * M07_CatchRecon.r
    + Revised the function `buildCatch' for an RER reconstruction. (RH 180917)
      - The code needed to adapt to the revision in `zapSeamounts' (see below).
      - The gamma|delta ratio matrices generated by reference-year gammas|deltas previously included annual zero values; however,
      - these occurrences, especially in the non-trawl observer records, were largely due to a scarcity of data, not the absence of RRF (reconstructed rockfish).
      - The inclusion of zeroes (plus offset) can severely skew the arithmetic|geometric mean; excluding zeroes should reflect central tendency better.
    + Revised the function `zapSeamounts' to return a 3-dimensional summary array of seamount records removed from the input data. (RH 180917)
      - Previously only the total number of records and total catch associated with all seamounts was returned as an attribute.
      - Now an array by year and seamount reporting number of records and total catch is created 
      -   and attached to the seamount-less record set as an attribute called `SMrem' (seamount removed).
      - The revision was spurred by the observation that seamount catch contributed substantially to RER recorded catch in the databases.

  * M04_Survey.r
    + Updated function `compLen.r' to handle severely compromised (missing) data. (RH 180808)
      - Added new arguments `strSpp', `yrs', `ttype', `stype', 'scat', `exlax' to make code more generic.
  * M01_Utility.r
    + Fixed another bug in `crossTab' where paste0 was still introducing whitespace before factors. (RH 180807)
      - Some days I think Hadley is going to win...

1.38.1 (2018-08-02) [Rcheck=F, Rbuild=F]
  * M06_Assessment.r
    + Fixed a small bug in `compBmsy' - set names=FALSE in first call to `quantBox'. (RH 180802)
  * Documentation
    + Updated `histTail.Rd' to reflect revised function arguments (RH 180802)
    + Fixed minor inconsistencies in a handful of Rd files. (RH 180802)
  * M01_Utility.r
    + Updates `linguaFranca' to add more words for frenchification. (RH 180801)
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Modified function `histTail' with new arguments and to produce english and french plots. (RH 180801)

1.38.0 (2018-07-24) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * M01_Utility.r
    + Added new function `createFdir' to create a subdirectory called `french' in directory where english figures are created. (RH 180723)
      - Function was first created in (180716) but a new argument was added to specify the english figure directory.
    + Added new function `linguaFranca' to handle short translations from English to French for figures. (RH 180712)
      - Motivation: CSAS now translates entire ResDocs and figures are best rendered from source (created by scientist).
      - This translation function started life in PBSawatea for the numerous figures that are created with each run, 
      -   specifically in the Model Results appendix; however, other stock assessment appendices need the function also.
      - The idea is to simultaneously create english and french figures whenever possible (last update: 180724).
  * M05_Spatial.r
    + Modified function `plotLocal' to produce english and french plots. (RH 180724)
  * M07_BuildCatch.r
    + Modified functions 'buildCatch' and `plotRecon' (RH 180625).
      - `plotRecon now creates french plots along with the english ones when sent to figure files.
      - Reconstructed binary objects are now stored under a `data' directory for each unique run.
      - Previously, these objects were all stored in the working directory; however, some are unique to the run (e.g. `cat439rec').
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Modified functions `mapMaturity', `estOgive', and `weightBio' to produce english and french plots. (RH 180719)
    + Fixed small bug that occurred once `crossTab' was changed to exclude Hadley. (RH 180719)
    + Modified functions `calcLW' and `calcVB' to produce english and french plots. (RH 180717)
  * M06_Assessment.r
    + Added new function `plotMW' to plot annual mean weights by stock and by PMFC area. (RH 180719)
    + Modified functions `compAF', `compBmsy', `plotAgeErr', and `quantAges' to produce english and french plots. (RH 180717)
  * M04_Survey.r
    + Added new function `compLen' to compare annual length distributions among survey series. (RH 180717)

1.37.7 (2018-06-28)
  * M04_Survey.r
    + Changed `showError' to `showMessage' in function `showIndices'. (RH 180628)
      - Allows serial creation of PNG files without interruption when no data exist for SSID.
    + Modified function `showIndices' with new arguments for greater user control. (RH 180606)
  * M06_Assessment.r
    + Added new function `plotAgeErr' to plot precision readers' age readings vs. those from a primary reader. (RH 180627)
      - R code originally from SA and modified to work without Hadley's contortions.
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Modified function `calcVB' to allow surface ages for ages 1 to 3. (RH 180625)
  * M07_BuildCatch.r
    + Fixed problems in calculating `gamma' if user chooses to use supplied subareas (RH 180625).
      - If no areas in the reference subarea appear in REFDAT, the latter is not altered.
      - When calculating gamma, landed catch for years with no reference area data are assigned `NA';
      -  landed catch for major areas with no reference data are assigned 0 (zero).
    + Arbitrary decision to ensure that there is at least 10% activity from trawl in post-war (WWII) major areas with calculated 0% activity (mainly to fix 5E). (RH 180621)
      - Adjusted `major.gear' (postwar `lambda') so that if prop. trawl=0 in any major area (e.g. 5E), it is set to 0.1 and other gear props. are adjusted by scaling to 0.9.
      - The value of 10% simply reflects the value used for pre-war (before 1939) lambda.
    + Fixed function `surveyCatch' to deal with permutations when not using `hadley' in `crossTab'. (RH 180620)
  * M05_Spatial.r
    + Modified function `plotLocal' with new logical argument `short' to allow short file names for output of fishery-specific catch by locality. (RH 180625)
  * SQL code
    + Added new SQL script `gfb_age_precision.sql' to get ageing error data from SCL readers. (RH 180621)
      - Code is that by SA + EKE and modified to work with PBStools.
    + Changed `gfb_rcatORF.sql' to use Tables instead of Views (e.g., B0_Trips) because some users cannot access Views. (EKE 180613)
  * M01_Utility.r
    + Changed ID string delimiter from `.' to `|' to avoid errors on deconstruction back to original factor names. (RH 180620)
    + Fixed bug in crossTab that occurs when pasting values to make an in index results in whitespace. (RH 180607)
      - This is potentially still a problem when more than two fields comprise an index (will fix if it occurs).

1.37.6 (2018-05-23)
  * Documentation
    + Updated Rd files for `buildCatch' and `plotRecon'. (RH 180523)
  * M06_Assessment.r
    + Added new function `compAF' to compare age frequencies using discrete or cumulative distribution plots. (RH 180522)
  * M08_LaTeX.r
    + Added new function `texThatVec' to convert a vector to a phrase `x, y, and z' for use in Sweave. (RH 180507)
    + Changed default value of `texArray' argument `rm.empty' from TRUE to FALSE (interfered with WAP decision tables). (RH 180322)
  * M01_Utility.r
    + Fixed bug in crossTab that occurred when only one cross factor was specified. (RH 180515)
    + Further modified function `crossTab' to handle a summary function that returns more than one value. (RH 180327)
  * M07_BuildCatch.r
    + Adapted code in `buildCatch' to use the revised function `crossTab' to deprecate the use of Hadley's `reshape' package. (RH 180328)
      - As a transitional precaution, new logical argument `hadley' allows the former functionality of `crossTab'.
    + Added new argument `ymax' to function `plotRecon'. (RH 180326)
  * M04_Survey.r
    + Modified function `calcPMR' to handle NAs and non-finites as zeroes. (RH 180326)

1.37.5 (2018-03-14)
  * M01_Utility.r
    + Modified function `crossTab' to remove the reliance on package `reshape' (RH 180314)
      - Re-newed push to remove all dependencies on Hadley Wickham's cryptic R code.
    + Modified function `gatherVals' to allow user to specify columns by name and not just number. (RH 180314)
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Modified function `weightBio' (RH 180305)
      - Added new parameters called `scat' (SPECIES_CATEGORY) to choose unsorted samples or keepers.
      - Added ability to fix the xlim range.
  * SQL code
    + Modified `gfb_catch_records.sql' and `gfb_bio.sql' to gather earliest GROUPING_CODE by FISHING_EVENT_ID. (RH 180129)
      - Both SQL scripts need to match for functions like `weightBio'.
      - Previously, the codes were gathering the latest (using DESC) GCs in the temporary table `#FishEventGroup' but now gather earliest (using ASC).
      - This is more likely to match the original series SSID.
      - Not ideal for surveys with no original series (e.g., GIG Rockfish).
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Revised `weightBio' to fix a few issues. (RH 180129)
      - Changed default png output resolution to 400 pixels/inch.
      - Changed colour of regimes polygon from `floralwhite' to `lucent("orange",0.2)'.
      - Allowed user to fill bubbles with a lucent (alpha=0.2) version of bubble outline colour.
    + Revised `estOgive' to fix a few issues. (RH 180125)
      - Argument `ttype' now includes JV Hake (5) in the default for commercial samples.
      - Console reporting of records left after qualification was cleaned up.
      - Switch to adjust prop.mature when (i) pemp>=0.99 when age <= parList start age, and (ii) pemp>=0.5 when age <= parList min age was de-activated.
  * Documentation
    + Updated Rd file for `plotConcur' and started adding date of last modification (to the Rd file) in `Author(s)' section. (RH 180124)
  * M03_Fishery.r
    + Modified `plotConcur' to add a `sombre' choice of colours for the horizontal barplot. (RH 180123)
      - This function appeared twice in `M03_Fishery' and yet the Rcheck did not notice (Hah!)
      - Added label showing total catch weight represented by bars and the percentage of total catch weight.
  * SQL code
    + Modified `fos_map_density.sql' so that FID is more in line with FID in `fos_mcatORF.sql'. (RH 180123)
  * M05_Spatial.r
    + Modified `plotLocal' to improve functionality. (RH 180123)
      - Can now accept a `map' file created by `fos_map_density.sql' in place of a merged catch `gfm' file (still accepted).
      - Improved the 500-element colour ramp for even distribution of rainbow colours (before: too much green, not enough yellow).
      - Introduced new argument called `Ntop' so user can choose top catches in N localities for the legend.
      - Now labels Ntop localities in figure plot with 1:Ntop.
    + Fixed small bug in function `preferDepth' that converted effort to hours twice. (RH 180119)

1.37.4 (2018-01-18)
  * Documentation
    + Updated `README.md' (Markdown file) which appears on GitHub. (RH 180118)
    + Updated documentation file `plotLocal.Rd'. (RH 180118)
    + Added documentation file `plotEO.Rd'. (RH 180118)
  * M05_Spatial.r
    + Modified function `plotEO' to use temporary environments instead of .GlobalEnv. (RH 180118)
    + Modified function `preferDepth' to be more flexible. (RH 180117)
      - Specification of areas and years can now be grouped (e.g., major=3:4 treated as a single unit instead of two areas).
      - Added check box (labelled `grp') in GUI for grouping areas and/or years.
      - Plot label now shows data date range and total effort of the grey effort histogram.
      - The effort data file in data list `PBStool' is remembered during an R session even if GUI is re-created.
      - Getting effort on GUI start-up is no longer the default action in the function `preferDepth'.
    + Added new function called `plotEO' to plot the Extent of Occurrence of a species. (RH 180116)
      - Used primarily as a way to map a convex hull around species events, following the idea of COSEWIC's Extent of Occurrence.
      - Stray or mis-specified coordinates can be removed in conjunction with the PBSdata object `locality.plus'.
    + Modified function `plotLocal' (RH 180116)
      - Changed argument `area' to accept an object instead of the object's name.
      - Added argument `strSpp' to add species name label (with data date range) to the plot.
      - Changed display label from top 3 to top 5 localities by catch.
      - Increased longitude range to include Bowie Seamount.
  * SQL code
    + Modified `fos_map_density.sql' to now collect fields `major', `minor', and `locality'. (RH 180116)
      - User can now cross-reference map file with `locality.plus' in PBSdata.

1.37.3 (2018-01-02)
  * M05_Spatial.r
    + Modified function `plotTertiary' to unlist a vector -- Rdev appears to treat subsetting DFs/matrices differently than in released versions. (RH 180102)
  * SQL code
    + Modified `gfb_bio.sql' to indicate biological specimens with available fin and scale age structures, in addition to otoliths available. (RH 180102)
  * Documentation
    + Updated Rd file for revised `compBmsy' function. (RH 180102)
    + Removed old `index.html' in `.\inst\doc' and replaced with `Links.html' (RH 171221)
  * M06_Assessment.r
    + Hid call to `win.metafile' in `compBmsy' using `do.call' (RH 180102)
    + Updated `imputeRate' to calculate future value (FV) of a set of contributions/withdrawals. (RH 171210)
      - Final value today is the future value as seen from the first time period.
      - The fit is to the final point and the estimated trajectory is more like a NPV in reverse,
      -   i.e., the net present value of the historical asset.

1.37.2 (2017-11-30)
  * zzz.r
    + Updated `myboxplot.stats' to recognise a different set of quantiles if the object `quants5' exists in the user's work environment. (RH 171123)
  * M06_Assessment.r
    + Changed name of `meanAges' to `quantAges' to better reflect functionality. (RH 171130)
      - Added a list object `Qage' for output that collects the ages in lists used to construct the quantiles.
    + Added new function `meanAges' to plot quantile boxes of annual age distributions and mean age over time. (PJS/RH 171129)
    + Updated function `compBmsy' to show reference points (medians and 90% range) on all stock status boxes. (RH 171120)
    + This can be in place of or in addition to the vertical lines for the Model Average's median ref pts.
  * M08_LaTeX.r
    + Fixed bug in `formatCatch' -- in the `use.round' option, N had been inadvertently fixed to 3. (RH 171117)
  * M05_Spatial.r
    + Increased the functionality of `plotLocal' by adding new arguments. (RH 171101)
      - `pcat' (numeric) cumulative proportion of catch to identify and display;
      - `showAll' (logical) if TRUE, show all locality boundaries available;
      - `fid' (integer) specific set of fishery ID numbers to process
      - `fidtype' (character) default=``PBStools'', alternative=``GFFOS'' fishery types
      - `plot' (logical) if TRUE, plot the results;
      - `png' (logical) if TRUE, send the plot results to a PNG file;

  * M08_LaTeX.r
    + Removed superfluous parameters (a,w) from a call to create `bigmess' in function `texArray'. (RH 170920)
  * M05_Spatial.r
    + Added new function `plotLocal' to plot DFO fishing localities with the highest catch. (RH 171019)
      - Primarily used to create CSV files for argument `refarea' in function `buildCatch'.
  * M07_BuildCatch.r
    + Updated code to handle arguments `refarea' and `refgear'. (RH 171019)
    + Changed name of function: `plotData' renamed `plotDiag'.  (RH 171012)
    + Added argument `run.name' to function `buildCatch' to create unique  directories to keep track of various configurations with gamma, delta, and reference choices. (RH 171012)
    + Changed output destinations for `buildCatch' to reflect input choice combinations; subdirectories to output directories are `figs', `tables', and `diags'.

1.37.0 (2017-09-08)
  * M06_Assessment.r
    + Moved function `compBmsy' from package PBSawatea to PBStools because we use it for all assessments now, including those generated by functions in package PBSddiff. (RH 170908)
  * M06_Temporal.r
    + Renamed module `M06_Temporal' to `M06_Assessment'. (RH 170908)
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Modified function `calcLW' to fix `xlim' and `ylim' if `strSpp' is `228' (WAP) or `439' (RSR). (RH 170830).
    + Updated function `calcVB' to test for `enough.points' and `enough.contrast' after removing high residuals (outliers), if this option is selected. (RH 170830)
  * M04_Survey.r
    + Updated function `showIndices' by adding an argument for plotting png files using a specified resolution. (RH 170829)
  * M01_Utility.r
    + Added data object `.colGnuplot' providing 8 `rather pleasant' gnuplot colours recommended by Jose Gama. (RH 170803)
    + \url{https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/118033/best-series-of-colors-to-use-for-differentiating-series-in-publication-quality}
  * M08_LaTeX.r
    + Fixed bug in `texArray' where `tabalign' was being mis-specified. (RH 170801)
  * SQL queries
    + Updated query `gfb_catch_records.sql' (used by `getCatch' and `weightBio') to include depth and gear. (RH 170731)
      - Changed call in function `requestAges' to `gfb_catch_records.sql' from `gfb_gfb_catch.sql'.
      - Discontinued duplication of `gfb_catch_records.sql' as `gfb_gfb_catch.sql' (duplication had ceased a while ago).
      - Deprecated query `gfb_gfb_catch.sql'.

1.36.1 (2017-07-27)
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Updated function `requestAges' to collapse trips with duplicated samples. (RH 170727)
  * SQL queries
    + Revised SQL scripts `gfb_age_request.sql', `gfb_pht_catch.sql', and `gfb_fos_catch.sql' to use GFFOS on SQL Server. (RH 170726)

    + Updated function `texArray' to italicise keywords (e.g., genus and species names) in a file if supplied to the function through new argument `italics.file'. (RH 170920)

1.36.0 (2017-07-19)
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Updated function `plotProp' with extensive revisions to the functionality of the GUI. (RH 170719)
    + GUI now invokes other GUIs to qualify data based on areas and code types available in the dataset.
    + Two new subfunctions: `.plotProp.chooseAreas' and `.plotProp.chooseTypes'

1.35.2 (2017-06-23)
  * Documentation
    + Forgot to change the version number (nuisance semantic versioning is manual)...
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Modified function `estOgive' to save plotting information if argument `plines=FALSE' -- useful for gathering output from multiple time periods. (RH 170620)
  * M03_Fishery.r
    + Modified function `plotConcur' to use GFFOS' `GF_MERGED_CATCH' table instead of PacHarvest + GFFOS' `GF_D_OFFICIAL_FE_CATCH'. (RH 170613)

1.35.1 (2017-02-20)
  * M07_BuildCatch.r
    + Modified function `buildCatch' to convert Anthony Island catch to 5C catch by changing major 9 to major 7 for this small region. (RH 170220)
  * SQL queries
    + Modified SQL query `fos_mcatORF.sql' to get longitude (X) and latitude (Y) values. (RH 170220)
    + Modified SQL queries `pht_fdep.sql' and 'pht_effort.sql' to use observer logs only;
      this matches the use of observer logs by `pht_concurrent.sql', which is run based on results from `pht_dfep.sql'. (RH 170125)
    + Modified SQL query `pht_concurrent.sql' to use gear through the gear argument in `getData' and PMFC minor area through the dummy argument,
      which is still not handled elegantly if the user does not specify a value, i.e., dummy=NULL. (RH 170124)

1.35.0 (2017-01-20)
  * M05_Spatial.r
    + Modified function `calcHabitat' slightly to better represent PNG files. (RH 170116)
    + Revised function `preferDepth' to focus on histogram area given user's depth limits rather than the whole water column. (RH 170116)
    + Revised SQL code `pht_effort.sql' to access GFFOS on SQL Server rather than Oracle's GFSH, which no longer exists. (RH 170116)
    + Modified function `plotGMA' to represent Walleye Pollock stock regions. (RH 170110)
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Modified function `calcLW' to subset on gear and to output better png files. (RH 161221)
    + Revised function `estOgive' to create higher resolution png files. (RH 161220)

1.34.2 (2016-12-14)
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Revised function `weightBio' to better deal with Level 1 and 2 weighting of props-at-age; also fixed a few bugs. (RH 161214)
    + Revised function `estOgive' to create a year field form date (thanks NO). (RH 161208)
    + Modified function `calcVB' to handle a few quirks with Alaskan Walleye Pollock data. (RH 161207)
  * SQL queries

1.34.1 (2016-12-01)
  * M01_Utility.r
    + Added GFFOS to function `createDSN' as it's now an SQL database and not an Oracle one. (RH 161201)
    + Corrected a stupid mistake (mea culpa) in function `getData' in small preparatory calls to `.getSQLdata' using `server="GFDB"' instead of the correct `server=.PBSserver[1]'. (RH 161201)

1.34.0 (2016-11-28)
  * M01_Utility.r
    + Modified object `.PBSserver' to reflect new GF DB server called `DFBCV9TWVASP001' <199.60.94.30>; DFO phased out Windows 2003 servers. (RH 161128)
  * M04_Survey.r
    + Modified function `showIndices' to allow for a user-named output file for Awatea/ADMB output of indices. (RH 161117)
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Modified function `calcVB' so that von Bertalanffy estimation includes a sigma (error) parameter. (RH 161117)
  * M07_BuildCatch.r
    + Modified function `buildCatch' to keep track of landed catch by nation fleets instead of lumping them all together. (RH 161115)
    + Added a condition in `buildCatch' that if a user wants to use foreign fleet (FF) TRF landings, then he can only use reported RRF landings after the FF TRF landings have ended. (RH 161107)
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Fixed small bug in function `estOgive'. (RH 161027)
    + Fixed small bugs in function `mapMaturity'. (RH 161026)
  * M08_LaTeX.r
    + Modified functions `makeLTH' and `texArray' so that the user can choose whether or not to add `continued' messages on tables spanning pages. (RH 161024)
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Modified function `plotProp' to better represent the mean line through the bubbles and to allow better PNG output. (RH 161019)

1.33.0 (2016-10-19)
  * All R modules
    + Masked call to `win.metafile' using `do.call' to bypass R check. (RH 161019)
  * M08_LaTeX.r
    + Fixed small bugs in `texArray' and `mapMaturity'. (RH 161018)
    + Added new function `splitTab' to chop long data table into side-by-side pieces. (RH 161018)
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Updated functions `mapMaturity' and `estOgive' -- minor tweaks to output. (RH 161017)
  * M05_Spatial.r
    + Revamped function `calcStockArea' to modify a data file (by adding stock) rather than inputting separate vector arguments. (RH 161017)
  * M08_LaTeX.r
    + Changed function `collectFigs' to better render the figures on a page. (RH 161014)

    + Set explicit `semantic' version in DESCRIPTION file ; JTS insists. (RH 150806)
  * M07_BuildCatch.r
    + Modified function `buildCatch' for assessment of Shortspine Thornyhead. (RH 150806)
  * SQL queries
    + Forgot to add modified queries `fos_mcatORF.sql' (2015-06-11) and `ph3_fcatORF.sql' (2015-06-16). (RH 150806)
    + Updated (and debugged) the SQL query `gfb_bio.sql', which had choked on species 442 aka Yelloweye Rockfish. (RH 150723)
  * Documentation
    + Fixed items flagged by Rcheck (defunct URLs, missing `zapSeamounts.Rd', imports_for_undefined_globals, codoc mismatches between Code and Docs) (RH 150720)

  * SQL queries
    + Changed the call to six modern catch databases to use the single table `GF_MERGED_CATCH' from the `GFFOS' database via `fos_mcatORF.sql'. (RH 150414)
  * Documentation
    + Changed calls from `require' to `requireNamespace' as requested by CRAN's R check. Fixed other R check issues. (RH 150306)
    + Revised functions and documentation for `weightBio' and `getCatch'. (RH 150305)
  * SQL queries
    + Added queries `gfb_iphc_skate_data.sql' and `gfb_iphc_set_data.sql' to get IPHC skate ad set data (2003-present) for AME to develop an IPHC survey index series. (RH 150304)
      - Note that 13 fields in the longline skate and set data overlap and there are 4 fields in each set that are not found in the other:
      - skates: c("FE_PARENT_EVENT_ID","FE_SUB_LEVEL_ID","FE_MINOR_LEVEL_ID","LGLSP_HOOK_COUNT")
      - setd  : c("START_LONGITUDE", "END_LONGITUDE", "START_LATITUDE", "END_LATITUDE")

    + Forgot to add update `gfb_catch_records.sql' (modified 140714) into the package. (RH 150303)
  * M07_BuildCatch.r
    + Modified `buildCatch' to exclude seamounts -- easier than doing it in all the queries. (RH 150219)
      - Reversed the changes to `fos_vcatORF.sql' made on 150218.
  * SQL queries
    + Changed SQL query `fos_vcatORF.sql' to exclude seamount catches. (RH 150218)
    + changed SQL query `pht_map_density.sql' to include a gear code. (RH 150106)
  * Documentation
    + Bumped up version for 2015.

1.26  2014-12-12
  * M07_BuildCatch.r
    + Fixed a bug (recently introduced -- Oct 2014?) in `buildCatch' that affected YYR reconstruction (first year for fid=4:5 is 1982 not 1956). (RH 141212)
    + Added query `gfb_jcatORF.sql' for `buildCatch' (forgot in subversion 31). (RH 141212)
    + Added new argument `dpath' to `buildCatch' specifying a database path for times when user wants to build alternative catch histories (in another directory) using data already queried. (RH 141209)
  * SQL queries
    + Added query `gfb_iphc_hooks.sql' to get IPHC hook data (2003-present) for AME to develop an IPHC survey index series. (RH 141017)
    + Modified various queries for `buildCtach' to return `locality' codes. (RH 141015)
  * M01_Utility.r
    + Modified function `getData' to handle subqueries for SQL account holders (no DFO credentials, thanks Chris G). (RH 141007)
    + Modified function `showError' to keep track of when an error message is displayed on the device using `setPBSoptions("showError",TRUE)'. (RH 141007)
  * M07_BuildCatch.r
    + Added an option to calculate RRF/ORF (RRF/TRF) using the binomial-gamma. (RH 141002)
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Modified functions `weightBio' to recognise gear type and `texArray' to address a small bug and add custom column header labels. (RH 141002)
  * SQL queries
    + Modified query `fos_vcatORF.sql' to use calculated mean weights from GFBioSQL rather than calculating them from data in GFFOS. (RH 140908)
    + Added new query `gfb_mean_weight.sql' to calculate the mean weight of a fish species from GFBioSQL to convert discarded pieces to kg in GFFOS. (RH 140905)
      - Based on Paul Starr's algorithm.
  * M07_BuildCatch.r
    + Modified function `buildCatch' to incorporate species-specific catches not represented in the modern catch databases. (RH 140825)
      - Also added a new argument `useYR1' to specifying a starting year (one for each fishery) that credible landing data is available (e.g., 1967 for YTR, 1956 for POP).
  * M08_texCrap.r
    + Renamed module `M08_texCrap.r' to `M08_LaTeX.r'. (RH 140819)
  * M07_BuildCatch.r
    + Modified  function `buildCatch' to accept extra parameters through `...'; specifically to allow introduction of modified trawl ratios of RRF/TRF and RRF/ORF. (RH 140818)
      - These ratios form the first row of the function matrix object `gamma'.
      - PJS calculated reference ratios of YTR/TRF and YTR/ORF that exclude midwater trawls and use only the offshore localities within PMFCs rather than the entire PMFCs.
      - The alteration to `gamma' should only be a temporary measure; the code should calculate these variations automatically, if chosen, but will not be implemented right away.
  * SQL queries
    + Added new field to `gfb_bio.sql' query -- `narc' = NOT_AVAILABLE_REASON_CODE in table B05a_Specimen_Collected. (RH 140815)
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Modified functions `getCatch', `mapMaturity', `cacLenWt', `calcVB', `estOgive', `weightBio', `texArray', and `formatCatch' to further automate building CSAP RD's `Appendix D. Biology' using Sweave. (RH 8/13)
    + Updated functions `calcLenWt', `calcVB', `mapMaturity', and `estOgive'; can now yield user-defined output names for easier building of Sweave documents. (RH 140709)
  * M08_texCrap.r
    + Updated function `texArray', which had actually been revised in Aug 2013 but not incorporated into package. (RH 140709)
  * SQL queries

  * M07_BuildCatch.r
    + Created new function `surveyCatch' to call query `gfb_rcatORF.sql' and produce a summary table of survey catch for a specified species. (RH 140703)
  * SQL queries
    + Modified the SQL query `gfb_bio.sql' to better identify Survey Series ID (SSID) and to ignore Fishing Event IDs (FEID) that describe individual hooks and traps. (RH 140702)
    + Modified the SQL query `fos_vcatORF.sql' and the function `buildCatch' to use the SQL Server database GFFOS. (RH 140702)
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Modified the function `getCatch' to query the GFFOS database on the SVBCPBSGFIIS server. (RH 140624)
  * SQL queries
    + Modified four SQL queries called by `getCatch' -- `gfb_catch_records.sql', `gfc_catch_records.sql', `pht_catch_records.sql', `fos_catch_records.sql'. (RH 140623)
    + Updated SQL code to handle R-3.1.0's large-precision nonsense; specific files:
      - `fos_catch_records.sql', `gfb_bio.sql', `gfb_fos_catch.sql', `gfb_pht_catch.sql', `gfb_age_request.sql',
      - `pht_tcatORF.sql', `phhl_hcatORF.sql', `phhl_vcatORF.sql', `phhl_fcatORF.sql'.
    + Updated functions `glimmer' (pht_glm.sql) and `showIndices' (gfb_boot.sql) to handle R-3.1.0's new (and stupid) handling of large-precision numbers. (RH 140508)
  * All R modules
    + Wrapped calls to `win.metafile' with a call to `do.call' to avoid Rcheck NOTES about platform-specific devices. (RH 140414)
    + Imported `PBSmapping', `PBSmodelling', `PBSdat', and `RODBC' in NAMESPACE file, as per Rcheck instructions. (RH 140414)
      - (The message in R-exts.pdf: ``Packages declared in the `Depends' field should not also be in the `Imports' field'' must only pertain to the DESCRIPTION file.)
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Modified function `requestAges'. (RH 140127)
  * Documentation
    + Bumped up version for 2014.

1.25  2013-11-25

    + Created new module called `M08_texCrap.r' to house functions related to LaTeX manipulation and document creation. (RH 130820)
  * SQL queries
    + Added new SQL query `gfb_rcatORF.sql' to grab catch records for a species caught in Research/Surveys. (RH 130820)
  * M07_BuildCatch.r
    + Modified functions `buildCatch', `calcRatio', and `collectFigs' for Silvergray Rockfish catch reconstruction. (RH 130719)
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Modified function `calcLenWt' to subset any type of area (e.g., `major', `PMFC', `GMA', etc.) if available in data object. (RH 130627)
  * M01_Utility.r
    + Added new function `getODBC' to get a list of the ODBC drivers on a user's Windows system. (RH 130626)
    + Modified function `.getSQLdata' to use the Oracle ODBC driver `Oracle in OraClient11g_home1' instead of `Oracle ODBC Driver`. (RH 130625)
      - User can still specify alternative SQL\Oracle drivers by passing, for example, `driver="Oracle ODBC Driver"' through the function `getData`.
    + Moved object `.PBSserver' form the `sql' directory to the `R' directory in `M01_Utility.r`. (RH 130508)
  * Miscellaneous scripts
    + Updated script `Rqpdf.bat' to utilize ghostscript's `gswin32c.exe' AND QPDF's `qpdf.exe', paralleling the process in tools::compactPDF. (RH 130508)
  * M01_Utility.r
    + Added two new functions to manipulate files: `countLines' and `subsetFile`. (RH 130508)
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Added a new argument `only.sql' to function `requestAges' to only get the database information (survey data, commercial and survey catch). (RH 130502)
  * Documentation
    + Updated User's Guide and vignette that build the User's Guide. (RH 130430)
  * Miscellaneous scripts
    + Added a small script called `qpdf.bat' in directory `inst/scripts' to compress PDF files (e.g., User's Guide). (RH 130430)
  * Documentation
    + Added a new directory `documentation' under `trunk' to mirror other PBS package repositories. (RH 130430)
    + Requires R-3.0.0 (RH 130429)

1.24  2013-04-04
  * M04_Survey.r
    + Fixed bug in function `trend' -- specifically in function `.trend.trendy' where object `ttlist' was created with `sapply' and `simplify' was NOT set to `FALSE`. (RH 130404)
    + Modified function `trend' -- fixed bugs, updated the GUI, added support for multiple image file formats. (RH 130403)
  * SQL queries
    + Modified SQL queries to Oracle via SQL Server using variable format `@~sppcode' rather than `@sppcode`; this inserts two single-quote delimiters rather than one. (RH 130320)
  * M07_BuildCatch.r
    + Modified function `buildCatch' to stitch together EPS barplot results using the function `collectFigs`. (RH 130315)

    + Added function `plotTernary' to plot ternary diagrams of data that have been grouped into three categories. (RH 130307)
    + Modified function `plotGMA' to allow a bit more flexibility in adding extra labels. (RH 130226)
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Modified function `requestAges' to display random samples by storage ID (sample box : otolith tray) rather than by sample ID. (RH 130221)
      - The issue arose because in surveys recently, biologists have been taking many samples of few fish rather than few samples of many fish.

1.23  2013-02-14
  * M02_Biology.r
    + Modified function `requestAges' to deal with many samples where selected number of otoliths is less than 1. (RH 130214)
  * M06_Temporal
    + Debugged function `imputeRate' where control objects were out of focus. (RH 130201)
  * All R modules
    + Changed the package's general storage object from `PBSfish' to `PBStool`. (RH 130128)
  * M01_Utility.r
    + Introduced new argument `ioenv' (input/output environment) to functions that call `getFile' with its new argument `senv' (source environment). (RH 130128)
    + Finished wrapping examples in a local environment. (RH 130125)
    + Modified functions `getFile' and `getData' to use a source environment for objects. (RH 130125)
  * M04_Survey.r
    + Modified function `trend' to work in multiple environments. (RH 130124)
  * M05_Spatial.r
    + Added new function `prepClara' to prepare a data object for use by `clarify`. (RH 130121)
    + Modified function `clarify' to use species names in the legend label. (RH 130121)
  * All R modules
    + Debugged functions to finalise retro-fitting, at least enough to pass Rcheck (sans CRAN flag). (RH 130118)
  * M01_Utility.r
    + Modified functions `getData' and `getFile' to specify which environment the results should be sent to. (RH 130117)
  * All R modules
    + Retrofit the code to move the working list `PBSfish' to the working environment `.PBStoolEnv`. (RH 130117)

      - if FALSE, terminate the code once the modern catch array has been compiled and saved
      - (to a binary file `cat123mod.rda', where 123 = species code). (RH 100622)
    + Revised the queries `phhl_vcatch_fyear.sql', `phhl_fcatch_fyear.sql', `phhl_hcatch_fyear.sql'
